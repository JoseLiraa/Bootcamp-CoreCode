3. we get the result

- **Why is pseudocode helpful?**
- [x] A: The pseudocode is very helpful, because it allows us to create a strategy of how to solve a problem, step by step, without worrying about coding, in this way we can be very specific about the steps we want our program to do in order to solve a problem.

- **Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)**
- [x] A: 
1. We ask the user for the year of birth.
2. We store the year of birth in the variable: "yearBirth".
3. we define the current year and it is stored in the variable: "currentYear".
4. we create a variable: "age"
5. inside the variable "age" we store the result of the subtraction of "currentYear" minus "yearBirth".
6. We print the "age" variable, which shows us the result of the calculation, which is the age of the user.

- **Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?**
- [x] A: A flowchart allow us to convert complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams, show what is the flow and sequence of processes to carry out an activity.
